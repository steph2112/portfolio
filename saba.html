                    <h6>About Saba:</h6>
                    <p>
                        Saba is a leading urban mobility company specializing in parking management across Spain and
                        other
                        European and Latin American countries. Focused on innovation and accessibility, Saba offers
                        digital
                        solutions like online booking and EV support to create smarter, user-centered city experiences.

                <div class="project-details-box">
                    <h6>Saba’s needs:</h6>
                    <p>
                        Saba identified the need to redesign their website after data revealed low conversions. They
                        needed
                        a more intuitive parking search and clearer user flows, while working within a limited budget
                        and
                        ensuring compatibility with their existing, technically constrained platform.

                </div>
                <div class="project-details-box">
                    <h6>The Challenge we found:</h6>
                    <p>
                        After reviewing the platform and user flows, I identified three main issues impacting the
                        experience:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outdated design – The interface lacked clarity and modern structure, leading to confusion
                            and low conversions.</li>
                        <li>Unclear service structure – Multiple offerings were poorly categorized, making them hard to
                            understand.</li>
                        <li>Inefficient search – The parking tool wasn’t user-friendly or accessible, and needed a more
                            intuitive redesign.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-details-box highlight">
                    <h6>The Solution:</h6>
                    <p>
                        To improve the overall experience, <strong>a new website was designed</strong> with the
                        following key changes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>responsive and modern interface</strong>, aligned with Saba’s branding, that feels
                            clear and easy to use.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>simplified search tool</strong> and reorganized product structure that help users
                            quickly find nearby parking and better understand Saba’s offerings.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>flexible design</strong> that that easily adapts to the needs and structure of any
                            local market.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Competitive Analysis :</h6>
                        <p>As part of my research, <strong>I analyzed 10 direct competitors, both national and
                                international</strong>, to
                            better understand how other companies structure their digital experience.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I looked into their <strong>parking search tools, product categorization, checkout flows,
                                and
                                whether they guided users through product selection</strong>. I noticed that most
                            competitors focused
                            mainly on showing hourly prices, with little to no effort in explaining product types or
                            their benefits. <strong>None of them had a product recommender, their map searches were
                                static, and
                                very few offered detailed product pages</strong>.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            These gaps helped me identify clear opportunities for Saba to offer a more user-friendly and
                            differentiated experience.

                    <h6>User Research & Insights</h6>
                    <p>
                        I worked closely with a UX researcher to better understand how users interact with Saba’s
                        services. <strong>We interviewed occasional, regular, and frequent users</strong> to learn about
                        their habits and
                        pain points when using the parking platform. We also <strong>reviewed web store feedback and
                            used Hotjar
                            to observe real user behavior</strong>. These insights helped us spot key areas for
                        improvement and
                        guided design decisions that made the experience smoother and more useful.</p>

                        <p>During the Research and Empathize phase, we <strong>conducted intensive workshops with
                                various
                                stakeholders, including IT, Marketing, Sales, and SEO teams</strong>. The primary goal
                            was to
                            thoroughly understand their needs, concerns, and aspirations, while also identifying
                            <strong>potential limitations and constraint</strong>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This collaborative approach was crucial in shaping a solution that not only met their
                            diverse requirements but also aligned with their broader objectives. Our aim was to ensure
                            the final product was the best possible solution for all involved.

                        intuitive navigation. The menu was simplified to focus on the most visited and important pages,
                        improving the overall user experience.

                    <p>
                        Based on the lessons learned, we have designed an improved Main Navigation, with the following
                        strategic insights:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear and easy access</strong> to the most important pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Always visible</strong> on the desktop (to avoid having hidden elements and a second
                            click).</li>
                        <li><strong>With dropdown options</strong> for those markets that need a second level of
                            navigation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aligned with the needs</strong> of Business and Users.</li>
                        <li>We have added <strong>abandoned cart functionality</strong> in the main menu. (Phase 2 of

                    <h6>Wireframes:</h6>
                    <p>
                        I created <strong>low-fidelity wireframes</strong> to define the overall layout and key
                        functionalities of Saba
                        Web. These were <strong>presented to various stakeholders</strong> from the client side to
                        ensure alignment with
                        business objectives and gather early feedback. One of the main challenges was designing the
                        parking search functionality, which led us to <strong>conduct specific user tests</strong> to
                        validate and refine
                        this feature. After several rounds of iteration, incorporating both stakeholder input and user
                        insights, I refined the wireframes into high-fidelity designs.

                    <p>
                        <strong>I created a style guide and design system based on SABA’s corporate identity</strong>,
                        ensuring a simple
                        and cohesive visual language aligned with their brandbook. <strong> I defined core UI
                            components,
                            interactive states, and specifications </strong> support developers and maintain consistency
                        across the

                        design focused on clean layouts,
                        minimal UI, and a modern, consistent visual style aligned with the brand.

                            At the end of each sprint, <strong>we delivered the corresponding screens to the
                                developers</strong>, along
                            with <strong>a comprehensive Figma file containing all documentation: user flows,
                                components,
                                states, and use cases</strong>. At the client’s request, we also prepared an
                            <strong>additional document
                                outlining the specific functionality of each screen</strong>.
                            <br /><br />
                            After delivery, we collaborated closely with the development team, conducting QA sessions to
                            ensure the final implementation matched the designed experience.

                            search, parking detail page, checkout, and product management. The client decided to split
                            the development into phases due to budget constraints.
